								<h2>US Race Relations</h2>
							</div>
							<div class="ftf-content-box">	
								<p>U.S. Race Relations began as – and continues to be – the core of our work and mission. We, as Americans, live largely segregated lives. We rarely understand the differences between us, and we tend to think in ways that keep legacies of distrust alive. As a consequence, race has become taboo, a topic to be avoided. When race is discussed publicly, it is all too often with the oversight of simplistic attitudes about political correctness.</p>
								<p>In our Race Relations dialogues, we provide an ideologically neutral space where participants are able to explore their thoughts, ideas, and questions about race, no matter what they are. We challenge people of all ancestries to examine the biases, the rumors, and the inherited scripts we all live with, and to listen to the stories of people who appear to be on the other side.</p>
								<p>These conversations, which typically involve eight participants, are facilitated by two trained facilitators. The facilitators use their training to create a space where all perspectives – from the far left to the far right – are unearthed and discussed.</p>

								<h2>Gender</h2>
							</div>		
							<div class="ftf-content-box">	
									<p>With growing concerns about university culture across America, our Gender dialogues have evolved to provide a space for Penn State students to discuss their experiences of and perspectives on gender. We explore the structural components of gender today by discussing what it is like to be a man or a woman, and what things influence our perception and actions. From alcohol and football to negotiating the sexual realm, these dialogues allow students to share personal stories and examine the role of gender in their personal lives as well as in the Penn State community.</p>
